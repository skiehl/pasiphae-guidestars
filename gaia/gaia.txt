We are selecting the guide stars from the Gaia archive. I am working with
local VOTables.

I am using a Galactic Latitude limit of +/-28 deg instead of +/-30 deg, because
fields near the limit may contain stars at latitudes lower than +/-30 deg.
Those stars should be taken into consideration for the overlap tests.

I ran these queries:

SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_g_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_g_mean_mag <= 12
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_g_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_g_mean_mag > 12
    AND phot_g_mean_mag <= 13
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

    SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_g_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_g_mean_mag > 13
    AND phot_g_mean_mag <= 14
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_g_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_g_mean_mag > 14
    AND phot_g_mean_mag <= 14.5
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

    SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_g_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_g_mean_mag > 14.5
    AND phot_g_mean_mag <= 15
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

SELECT source_id, ra, dec, phot_g_mean_mag
FROM gaiadr3.gaia_source_lite
WHERE (
    phot_g_mean_mag > 15
    AND phot_g_mean_mag <= 15.4
    AND (
        b >= 28
        OR b <= -28
        )
    );

NOTE: 3M sources seems to be a query limit. This is why I started to use
smaller magnitude bins towards higher magnitudes.

I used the following file naming convention:
- For the first query: `gaia_g_mag12_b28.vot`
- For the following queries: `gaia_g_mag12-13_b28.vot` where the magnitude
  numbers should match the limits of the query.
